Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room has requested Creative Technology Solutions to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their existing game, Draw It or Lose it. This game is loosely based on the 1980’s television game Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. The application will render images from a large library of stock drawings as clues for the team members to solve the puzzle (a phrase, title, or thing). There are four rounds lasting one minute each. Drawings are rendered at a steady rate and are fully complete at the 30 second mark. If the team does not guess the puzzle before the time expires, the remaining teams can offer one guess each to solve the puzzle within 15 seconds. 

The Gaming Room would like this to be a web-based game to have one instance of the game exist in memory at any given time. To implement this, CTS will utilize a singleton pattern to ensure only one instantiation of the game while utilizing unique identifies. Software requirements include having the ability to have one or more teams, each team can have multiple players, and that game and team names are unique and be checked if they are in use. 


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I was able to articulate my suggestions well within this documentation well and providing supporting information for these suggestions. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I could see many benefits of this documentation when developing code. This document would help prioritize the requirements of project.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would improve the design constraints of this document by making it a bit more concise. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by listing them in the technical and business requirements in the document. It is important to consider these when designing because it will be driving the development of the program. It necessary to remain within these requirements to provide a quality product while not going into technnical debt.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I would use this template in the future as it serves a concise and thorough way to work through the requirements of a program.
